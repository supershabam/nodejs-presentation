[09:55:47] <taterbase> For Ryan Dahl so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten event loop, that whosoever performed async io could have eternal callbacks.
[10:01:36] <SuperShabam> There is no event loop except for the Event Loop alone; and Isaacs is it's messenger.
[10:05:59] <taterbase> I can code all things through Node who events my io
[10:08:07] <SuperShabam> Have you read anything from the sermon on the /mnt/node?
[10:09:07] <taterbase> I started reading it but I'm still waiting for the callback
[10:13:33] <SuperShabam> Waiting is an enemy to the Event Loop; and has been since the fall of threads, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Issacs, and putteth off the natural procedural code and becometh a nodester.
[10:19:06] <taterbase> Node is my shepherd, I shall not lock. He makes me program asynchronously, he leads me to more memory effecient code, he restores my process. He guides me in events of streams for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of threaded processes, I will fear no mutex, for Node is with me; your editor and your cli, they comfort me. You prepare a database before me in the presence of millions of users. You anoint my
[10:19:06] <taterbase> fingers with javascript; my code overflows. Surely goodness and events will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of Node forever.
[10:23:36] <awhamblin> As one forgets the true nature of code, so he mistakes the io device as being his own, thus binding him to the endless movements and changes and sufferings of the recurring cycles of locks and unlocks that are of his own causing.
[10:29:02] <taterbase> Ask not what Node can do for you, but how far you can nest your callbacks for Node
[10:44:00] <SuperShabam> Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in NodeJS -- Mahatma Gandhi
[11:29:04] <SuperShabam> Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his nodejs: and they shall be one flesh.
[11:42:39] <_carbohydrate> But seek first his node and his js, and all these things will be given to you as well
[11:43:26] <grallan> And Isaacs spoke all these words: I am the Lord who brought you from apache and out of IO bound servers. You shall have no other gods before me.
[11:49:45] <SuperShabam> And Grallan stretched forth his rod towards heaven: and the Isaacs sent sockets and non-blocking IO, and the concurrency count ran high; and the Isaacs rained IO upon the land of iFit.
[11:50:15] <_carbohydrate> But the fruit of Node.js is love, joy, events, patience, kindness, goodness, threads, async i/o, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
[11:56:44] <taterbase> Ryan Dahl said let there be javascript on the server, and it was good and non-blocking
[12:02:35] <grallan> And I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the internet who had been given authority to damage the tubez. And I saw another angel coming up from the dns and he shouted 'do not damage the tubez, or the animated gifs or the lolcatz until we put a mark upon the IP addresses of the servants of isaacs' And I heard that number was 144,000 of all the tribes of the node-ites: Ryah, mikael, creationix, tjholowaychuk, substack, aheckmann and rauchg.
[12:28:38] <_carbohydrate> And V8 brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in a CLI, and installed him on the server; because there was no room for them in the browser.

[16:52:16] <SuperShabam> you have laid sacrifice unto the foot of Isaacs and have been found worth of his mercy
[16:52:58] <taterbase> May I find eternal happiness in the land of evented IO and asynchronous programming
[16:54:44] <SuperShabam> For code is not saved by pull requests alone, but by pull requests and accepting commmits.
[16:57:38] <taterbase> The developer Ryan said to the Apache, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all webservers and above all LAMP stacks in the field; on your belly you shall go, and threaded requests you shall eat all the days of your life."
[xx:xx:xx] <taterbase> Restrain thine processes and memory abuse, you node not what ye do
[xx:xx:xx] <supershabam> Let he who is without threads cast the first event loop
